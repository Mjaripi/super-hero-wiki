# Superhero Wiki
A test connection project to the [SuperHero API](https://superheroapi.com/index.html)

The project is divided in two parts: a **react client** (on the client folder), to handle the query an visualize the data and a **node express client** (on the cors folder), to handle the requests to the API and realize some web scraping.
